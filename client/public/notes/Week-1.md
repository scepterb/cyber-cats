# Week 1: Linux Basics
(This week's meeting was partly based off of https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0020.php)

The **k____** and the **s____** are part of a larger system called the **_________ ________** (or "OS").
The OS also includes other tools:
- The OS's **________** allows you to store your own files in computer memory
- The OS's **________** convert a particular hardware's input (like a keyboards) into input the computer can recognize.

Note that because different OSs have different kernels, they can't always run each others scripts. Give an example of such a case: **_____**.

### THE BIG IDEA: 
We are learning the terminal commands for the **B___** shell, so we can only use these commands on OSs built to run **B____**. These OSs include **_____** and **______**, but not **W______**.  
Because 96.4% of the servers in the world run Linux, that is almost always the OS we'll work with.


### Bandit Wargame
You will connect SSH, a network protocol that lets you connect to another computer's shell from your own shell. The Bandit computer has SSH enabled, so connect using: `ssh banditX@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`  
(Be sure to keep notes about any other terminal commands you learn about, such as `cat`)

> Hint: If you're struggling with Level 3, go to the "Looking Around" section of [linuxcommand.org](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0030.php) to learn more about the different *flags* used with `ls`.  


### Getting help
https://cyber.wildcats.cc/resources has links to websites that go more in-depth about how Linux and the CLI work.  

Again, use the `-h` or `--help` flag to learn more about a command.
